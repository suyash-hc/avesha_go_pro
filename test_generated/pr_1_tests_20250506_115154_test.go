The generated tests for the new math package are as follows:

Test for Add function:
```go
package math

import "testing"

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
	result := Add(5, 3)
	expected := 8
	if result != expected {
		t.Errorf("Addition was incorrect, got: %d, want: %d", result, expected)
	}
}
```

Please note that the test generation tool only generated a test for the Add function. You should generate similar tests for the Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Power, SquareRoot, and Abs functions in the math package.
