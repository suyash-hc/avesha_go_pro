The generated tests are placeholders and need to be replaced with actual Go test cases. Here's an example of how the tests might look:

```go
package math

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
	result := Add(10, 5)
	if result != 15 {
		t.Errorf("Expected 15, got %d", result)
	}
}

func TestSubtract(t *testing.T) {
	result := Subtract(10, 5)
	if result != 5 {
		t.Errorf("Expected 5, got %d", result)
	}
}

// Additional tests for Multiply, Divide, Power, SquareRoot, and Abs go here
```

This is a basic example and the actual tests may need to be more comprehensive depending on the requirements of the project.
